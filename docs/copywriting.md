# Clinic - Copywriting & Sales Scripts

## Elevator Pitch

**One Sentence:**
> "Clinic is a mobile CRM that helps aesthetic clinics convert Instagram and WhatsApp inquiries into paying customers by organizing leads, automating follow-ups, and providing sales visibility—all from your phone."

**30-Second Version:**
> "Every day, aesthetic clinics lose potential customers because leads slip through the cracks in Instagram DMs and WhatsApp chats. Clinic solves this by giving you a simple mobile CRM that captures all your inquiries in one place, shows them in a visual pipeline, and reminds you when to follow up. No more lost leads. No more forgotten messages. Just more bookings and closed sales—all managed from your pocket."

## Differentiators vs "No CRM" Scenario

### Side-by-Side Comparison:

| Without Clinic | With Clinic |
|----------------|-------------|
| Leads scattered across Instagram, WhatsApp, phone calls | All leads in one unified view |
| Scroll through chat history to find information | Instant access to lead details and notes |
| Forget to follow up, lose the sale | Automatic reminders ensure every follow-up happens |
| No idea what your conversion rate is | Real-time conversion and source tracking |
| Manually type price lists repeatedly | Quick templates and service list at your fingertips |
| Can't prove you followed up | Full history of every interaction |
| Hot leads go cold while you're busy | Priority queue keeps hottest leads on top |
| Overwhelmed by message volume | Organized workflow handles any volume |
| Staff works in silos, duplicating effort | Team visibility prevents overlap |
| Guessing what works | Data-driven insights for better decisions |

### Key Differentiators (Marketing Bullets):

1. **Built for aesthetic clinics** - Not a generic CRM adapted for you. Designed specifically for beauty and wellness businesses.

2. **Mobile-first, not mobile-adapted** - Created from day one for your phone. No desktop legacy holding it back.

3. **Instagram + WhatsApp native** - Designed around the channels where your leads actually come from.

4. **5-minute setup** - No training required. If you can use Instagram, you can use Clinic.

5. **Visual pipeline** - See your entire sales process at a glance. No more spreadsheets or mental tracking.

## Common Objection Replies

### "It's too expensive"

**Response:**
> "I totally understand—it's an investment in yourself! Many of our clients feel the same way initially. One thing that helps is our package pricing—when you commit to [X] sessions, you save [amount] compared to individual treatments. Would you like me to break down the package options for you?"

**Alternative:**
> "I hear you. What I can tell you is that our clients consistently tell us the results were worth every penny. We also offer [payment plans/financing] if that would make it more manageable. Should I share those options?"

---

### "I need to think about it"

**Response:**
> "Of course! It's a personal decision and you should feel comfortable. Can I ask what specifically you'd like to think over? Maybe I can help address any questions or concerns right now."

**Follow-up if they're hesitant:**
> "No pressure at all. How about I send you a quick summary of what we discussed via text? That way you have all the details when you're ready to decide. I'll also check in with you in a couple of days—does that work for you?"

---

### "I want to compare other clinics first"

**Response:**
> "That's completely fair—you want to make sure you're making the right choice! What I can tell you about [Clinic Name] is [unique value proposition—experience, technology, results, reviews]. But I totally respect wanting to do your research. Can I answer any specific questions that might help with your comparison?"

**Follow-up:**
> "Feel free to look around, and I'm here whenever you're ready. Would it be okay if I followed up in a few days to see if you have any questions after your research?"

---

### "I had a bad experience at another clinic"

**Response:**
> "I'm really sorry to hear that—that's so frustrating. Can I ask what happened? I want to make sure we address any concerns you might have."

[Listen actively]

> "Thank you for sharing that. At [Clinic Name], we [specific reassurance related to their concern—e.g., use only certified practitioners, have extensive consultation process, etc.]. Your comfort and results are our top priority. Would you feel better coming in for a consultation first so you can meet our team and see our space before committing to anything?"

---

### "I don't have time right now"

**Response:**
> "I completely understand—life gets busy! The good news is that [treatment] only takes about [duration], and we have flexible hours including [early/late/weekend] availability. When would typically be a better time for you—mornings, evenings, weekends?"

**Alternative:**
> "No problem! Would it help if I reached out in [timeframe—a month, after the holidays, etc.] when things might be calmer for you? I'd hate for you to miss out when you're ready."

---

### "I'm not sure this treatment is right for me"

**Response:**
> "That's exactly why we offer consultations! Our [practitioner/aesthetician] can assess your specific needs and recommend the best approach for your goals. There's no obligation to book treatment—it's just a chance to get personalized advice. Would you like to schedule a consultation?"

---

### "My friend/partner doesn't think I need it"

**Response:**
> "That's so sweet that they're involved! At the end of the day, though, this is about how *you* feel and what *you* want for yourself. Many of our clients come in wanting a little boost in confidence, and that's perfectly valid. What matters most is what makes you feel your best. Is there anything I can share that might help explain the benefits to them?"
