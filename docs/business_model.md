   - Staff forgets to respond to messages
   - Potential customers go to competitors

4. **No Pipeline Visibility**
   - Owners don't know how many leads are pending
   - No visibility into which stage leads are at
   - Cannot identify bottlenecks in sales process

5. **Zero Reporting**
   - No conversion rate tracking
   - Unknown lead source effectiveness
   - Cannot measure staff performance
   - No data-driven decision making

6. **Manual & Repetitive Work**
