SECTION 3: PROBLEM
================================================================================

[SECTION HEADLINE]
Sound Familiar?

[PROBLEM 1]
📱 Leads Buried in DMs
Your Instagram and WhatsApp are overflowing. By the time you respond, potential clients have already booked elsewhere.

[PROBLEM 2]
📝 Chaotic Lead Tracking
Sticky notes, spreadsheets, chat history scrolling... you've tried it all. Nothing sticks. Leads slip through the cracks.

[PROBLEM 3]
⏰ Forgotten Follow-Ups
You meant to call them back. Life happened. Now that hot lead is cold—or worse, at your competitor.

[PROBLEM 4]
📊 Flying Blind
No idea what your conversion rate is. No clue which lead sources work. You're guessing instead of growing.

[CLOSING STATEMENT]
You didn't start your clinic to spend nights tracking leads in spreadsheets.
