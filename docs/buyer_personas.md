   > "I use Instagram, WhatsApp, my notepad, and sometimes a Google Sheet. Nothing talks to each other. I spend half my time just trying to remember where I wrote something down."

3. **Repetitive responses**
   > "I type the same price list probably 15 times a day. Copy-paste from my notes, but it's still annoying. And sometimes I send outdated prices by accident."

### Direct Quote

> "I want to do a good job, but I'm fighting against chaos every day. If I had a simple app where I could see all my leads, mark where they are in the process, and get reminded who to call - I'd actually have time to sell instead of just scrambling to keep up."
